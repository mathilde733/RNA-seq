Projet of RNA-SEQUENCING about T.gondii infection: 

This project is a part of the study conducted by Shinghania et al, 2019. The samples are blood and lungs that were infected or not, as described on the table below.

First step: Quality control

You will find the script to perform a FastQC on ___ and then the script to perform a MultiQC on ____ . Additionally, I perform a trimming using trimmomatic but it was not necessary.

Second step: Mapping

Third step: Count the number of reads per gene

Final step: in R 
Exploratory data analysis 

Differential expression and overrepresentation analysis
