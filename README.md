**Projet: _Toxoplasma gondii_ infection in the _Mus musculus_ Model, Immune response and differentially gene expression analysis**

This project is a part of the study conducted by Singhania et al, 2019, [*Transcriptional profiling unveils type I and II interferon networks in blood and tissues across diseases*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10601-6).
The samples are mice's blood and lungs that were infected or not, as described on the table below.

**First step: Quality control**

You will find the script to perform a FastQC on ___ and then the script to perform a MultiQC on ____ . Additionally, I perform a trimming using trimmomatic but it was not necessary.

**Second step: Mapping**

**Third step: Count the number of reads per gene**

**Final step: in R** 

**Exploratory data analysis** 

**Differential expression and overrepresentation analysis**
